Floating-Point Types
--------
JavaScript is dynamically typed and will often convert implicitly between strings and floating-point numbers (which are IEEE 64 bit values). To force a variable to floating-point, use the global <code>parseFloat()</code> function.
		var num = parseFloat("3.5");

Decimal Types
-------------

TODO: is there a standard or widely used JS bignum/decimal library?

How to Round
------------
		var num = 5.123456;
		num.toPrecision(1) //returns 5 as string
		num.toPrecision(2) //returns 5.1 as string
		num.toPrecision(4) //returns 5.123 as string

TODO: talk about rounding modes; Firefox JavaScript seems to use round-half-odd
