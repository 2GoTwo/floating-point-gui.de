Why don't my numbers add up?
============================

So you've written some innocent code, say for example:

<pre>
    <a href="javascript:alert('0.1 + 0.2 is ' + (0.1 + 0.2))">0.1 + 0.2</a>
</pre>

and got a really unexpected result:

<pre>
    0.30000000000000004
</pre>

Maybe you asked for help on some forum and got pointed to a [long article with lots of formulas](http://docs.sun.com/source/806-3568/ncg_goldberg.html) that didn't seem to help with your problem.

Well, this site is here to:

* Explain concisely why you get that unexpected result
* Tell you how to deal with this problem
* If you're interested, provide in-depth explanations of why floating point numbers have to work like that and what other problems can arise

You should look at the [Basic Answers](/basic/) first - but don't stop there!
